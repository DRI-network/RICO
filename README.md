# Responsible Initial Coin Offering ( RICO ) Framework 

**Please be careful. This Version is Alpha. application may contain bugs.**

This framework is a decentralized framework, that makeing the initial coin offering more responsible and decentralized.

## Design Concept

In the case of the conventional ICO, the project owner can freely decide the process of generating the token. That is, the token design and token holding ratio is determined by the project owner. The sale of the token is done after issuance, and the project supporter purchases the issued token.

In our approach, all execution processes of issuing tokens are strictly defined on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and executed automatically. In addition, by automatically controlling the step of token generation, we can implement fair distribution for promoting system decentralization.

- Autonomous
- Comfortable 
- Decentralizing
- Equitable
- Mintable

## Dependencies

- Node v8.4.0
- Truffle v3.4.9
- solidty-compiler v0.4.15

This project using truffle framework, you can install truffle framework first.
reference for truffle => [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/)

```
$ npm install truffle@3.4.9 -g 
```
And you can using ethereumjs-testrpc for testing.
```
$ npm install ethereumjs-testrpc -g
```

## Getting Started 

### ropsten testnet deploy
Set up etheruem Geth node with modules.
```
$ geth --fast --rpc --testnet --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpcapi "personal,admin,eth,web3,net"
```
**Caution ropsten hit a Byzantium HardFork #1700000 you have to update geth to v1.7 and sync latest block.**

Add configuration to truffle.js 
```js
 testnet: {
      host: "192.168.0.103",  // geth rpc addr
      port: 8545,
      network_id: 3, // Match ropsten network id
      gas: 4612188,
      gasPrice: 30000000000
 }
  
```

Deploy Contracts.
```
$ truffle migrate --network testnet
``` 

### mainet deploy

Add configuration to truffle.js
```js
mainnet: {
      host: "10.23.122.2",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: 1, // Match main network id
      gas: 6312188,
      gasPrice: 30000000000
}
```
```
$ truffle migrate --network mainnet
``` 

## SimpleICO Reference

### Overview
RICO has several guid line api interfaces for ICOs. By combining these interfaces, implementing a flexible token issuing scheme. it call the token structure.
This code is an example of an ico contract using RICO.

```
 contract SimpleICO is RICO {
   string  name = "Responsible ICO Token";
   string  symbol = "RIT";
   uint8   decimals = 18;
   uint256 totalSupply = 400000 ether;                    // 40万 Tokenを最大発行上限
   uint256 tobAmountToken = totalSupply * 2 / 100;        // TOBの割合 2%
   uint256 tobAmountWei = 100 ether;                      // TOBでのETH消費量 100ETH
   uint256 PoDCapToken = totalSupply * 50 / 100;               // PoDでの発行50%
   uint256 poDCapWei = 10000 ether;                       // PoDでの寄付10000ETH

   uint256 firstSupply = totalSupply * 10 / 100;          // 1回目の発行量 10%
   uint256 firstSupplyTime = block.timestamp + 40 days;   // 1回目の発行時間（生成時から40日後)
   uint256 secondSupply = totalSupply * 69 / 100;         // 2回目の発行量　69%
   uint256 secondSupplyTime = block.timestamp + 140 days; // 1回目の発行時間（生成時から40日後)
   address mm_1 = 0x1d0DcC8d8BcaFa8e8502BEaEeF6CBD49d3AFFCDC; //マーケットメイカー
   uint256 mm_1_amount = 100 ether;                           //マーケットメイカーへの寄付額
   uint256 mmCreateTime = block.timestamp + 100 days;         //マーケットメイカーの寄付実行時間
   
 
   function SimpleICO() { } 
 
   function init(address _projectOwner) external onlyOwner() returns (bool) {
     init(totalSupply, tobAmountToken, tobAmountWei, PoDCapToken, poDCapWei, _projectOwner);
     initTokenData(name, symbol, decimals);
     addRound(firstSupply, firstSupplyTime, _projectOwner);
     addRound(secondSupply, secondSupplyTime, _projectOwner);
     addMarketMaker(mm_1_amount, mmCreateTime, mm_1, "YUSAKU SENGA");
     return true;
   }
 }
```
This Token issuing structure of the ICO is as shown in the figure below.
Token distribute round has been divided by two steps.

### RICO Guidline API Interface

#### function init(totalSupply, tobAmountToken, tobAmountWei, PoDCapToken, poDCapWei, projectOwner)
this function implement initialize RICO Framework and Deployment dependency contracts.
##### params
- projectOwner ( address ) -- a projcetOwner is a params of responsible token manager in RICO concept.if Ethereum address is checksumed, it may unmatch address that unable checksumed while the EVM operate codes.
- totalSupply ( uint256 ) -- a literal `ether` mean 10**18 on EVM execution. this case is decimals equal 18, this token available ether literal.
`400000 ether` mean 400,000 Token will be mint.
- tobAmountToken (uint256) -- TOB executes meaning the token generated by the tender offer is locked for a certain period of time and can not be issued freely. and TOB price defined by this token structure. people ask the question that token price is so cheaper ? but we claim that token price will touch the honestly price based on the prediction market action. if the owner buying so cheaper price. but token has been locked by contract. project owner has huge positive reputation rather than many conventional ICOs strategy **allocations**.
- tobAmountWei (uint256) -- represent Project TOB Cap o ETH.
- PoDCap (uint256) -- Proof of Doantaion (PoD) is a reservation of Token mint. if donate to project, ether wire defined in EVM executes. params proxy to DutchAuction contract in RICO contract.
- poDCapWei( uint256 ) -- represent Project HardCap of ETH.

#### function initTokenData(name, symbol, decimals)

EIP-20 is a TokenStandard Format on the Ethereum Blockchain.
`string` is a type in solidity. length **< 32bytes**. name is a represent Project name. sybmol is a represent Project ticker symbol. decimals is a represent a token multiplexer 1 token = 1*10^multiplexer. e.g. "Responsible ICO Token" ,"RIT","18".

##### params
- name (string) -- name is a represent token name.
- symbol (string) -- sybmol is a represent token symbol.
- decimals ( uint8 ) -- decimals is a represent token decimals.

#### function addRound(roundSupply, execTime, to);

**Round** is most important precept that mean token distribution program. it least one needs to be defined on RICO token structure.
##### params
- roundSupply (uint256) -- roundSupply represent a token mintable amount for this round.
- execTime (uint256) -- execTime represent a unlocking time and token creation time. adapt to `now` literal or `block.timestamp` reteral that return unixtimestamp.
- to (address) -- to represent a token receive address.

#### function addMarketMaker(distributeWei, execTime, maker, metaData)

This feature is more important precept of RICO Framework. project Owner will spent ether when TOB executed. that ether will be send to RICO contract.but anyone unable to sent ether from contarct in that case. So, RICO has to diestribute ETH to someone from contract.this precept must be defined in token strategy to sending ETH to someone and this method will be called by projectOwner. To decide someone to be honestly we design incentive models. it seems to be market maker.
#### params 
- distributeWei (uint256) -- distributeWei represent a distribute ether amount for this project.
- execTime (uint256) -- execTime represent a unlocking distribute time.
- maker(address)  -- maker is represent a ether receive address.
- metaData (uint256) -- metaData represent a market maker name or meta payload;

## Test 

### testing on ethereumjs-testrpc

```
$ truffle test 
```
### testing on ropsten testnet

please set timeout `this.timeout` if block confirmation too slow.
